Creating React APP:
  npx create-react-app todo-app

Setting-UP Firebase:
  Go to firebase console with gmail email account
  https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/
  
  Step 1:
    Add Project
    Give Project name: for e.g => todo-app
    We can enable google analytics for firebase project
    We can create new google analytic account or choose default
    Create Project
    Then click on continue
    You will end-ip on firebase page
  
  Step 2:
    Look at top-left corner project overview and click little settings icon
    Look at bottom for your apps, you will see there are no apps in your project
    next clik </> web dev icon
    give you app a nick name maybe => todo-app
    click also set Firebase hosting => this will help us in deployment
      Now we are going to see Add Firebase SDK this is how we include firebase code into our project
      We can ignore this for React use Node modules insteads
    Click next:
    This  is important step, copy command to install firebase globally to ypur computer
    by copying pasitng command to your terminal
      => npm install -g firebase-tools
      Whenever we are doing install -g it means we are inistalling it globally means around
      entire computer it doesen' matter if we are inside this project or that project. We are
      always going to have access to firebase tools.
    Click next:      
  
  Step 3:
    Copy paste firebase login command to your terminal
    Allow Firebase to collect CLI usage and error reporting information? (Y/n) : say y 
    Window will open please choose your account
    and then allow once its asked
    Click continue to console
  
  Step 4: 
    Scroll down on oyur console and find Firebase SDK snippet
    There click config and the object you see is important to connect to your firebase backend
    We can use it later.

  
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]); 
  we are using state its temporary memory, useState is react hook we need to import it
  from react to use it, useState([]); in this line we are telling intial state is an empty array

  In next step temporarily adding todo list to state and going to retereive it state
  using es6 map function. 
  { todos.map(todo) => (

  )} // () In these brackets we can return some html

Installing npm install @material-ui/core
  Frontend framework for UI design

Component is scomething we write once and use several times on several places, we can reuse that Component
Props stands for properties which allow is to diffrentiate one component from other
